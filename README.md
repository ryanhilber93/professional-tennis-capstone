# professional-tennis-capstone
## Project Description
In this project, I attempt to answer the question: “To what degree has improved racket technology and court homogenization changed the game of professional tennis over the last 5 decades?” In recent years, certain trends have emerged in the game of professional tennis that separates this era from the past. Many members of the media attribute these changes to improved racket technology and court homogenization. In this project, I explore the extent of the differences from this era to past years and look at some statistical measures that could help explain why this change has occured.
