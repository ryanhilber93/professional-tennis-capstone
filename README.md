## Project Description
In recent years, certain trends have emerged in the game of professional tennis that separate this era from the past. Many members of the media attribute these changes to improved racket technology and court homogenization. In this project, I explore the extent of the differences from this era to past years and look at some statistical measures that could help explain why this change has occured.

## Essential Question
To what degree has improved racket technology and court homogenization changed the game of professional tennis over the last 5 decades?
### Subquestions
1. Are the big titles concentrated among a smaller group of players more now than in the past?

2. Has the average age of winning players increased over the past 5 decades?

3. Are the top players winning across different court surfaces more now than in the past?

4. How have certain statistical measures changed over time (overall and by surface)?

## The Data
Two main datasets were used. [One](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) with a comprehensive list of all ATP tennis matches since 1968 with some statistics included (most statistics only included for matches 1991-present), and [one](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_slam_pointbypoint) with a comprehensive list of every point from every Grand Slam match since 2011 with many statistics included. All data taken from https://github.com/JeffSackmann.

## The Process
To complete my analysis, I started in python where I did some data cleaning and calculated some new columns. Then, I loaded my data into Power BI to create my narrative.

## Limitations
I was hoping to do a full, comprehensive study of how the game has changed since 1968 (the start of the open era). However, as mentioned above, many of the statistics that were included in the data were only given for a small subset of those years (1991-present and 2011-present). This means I wasn't able to answer my guiding questions to the extent that I would have liked.

## The Results
Overall, my findings showed that there have certainly been changes to the game, but the media may overhype the degree to which court homogenization has contributed to that. Looking back at my subquestions, questions 1-3 were answered with a resounding yes. However, there was little evidence to suggest that the statistical measures are becoming more similar among the three major court types.
